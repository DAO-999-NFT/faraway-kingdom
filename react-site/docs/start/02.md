# How to create an OpenSea account?

You'll need digital currency, a crypto wallet, and an OpenSea account to start buying or selling NFTs using OpenSea. Let's get started!

### Why do I need a wallet before buying and selling on OpenSea?

OpenSea is a tool you use to interact with the blockchain. We never take possession of your items or store your NFTs. Instead, we provide a system for peer-to-peer exchanges. Since you’ll be using OpenSea to interact directly with others on the blockchain, you’ll need a wallet to help you turn your actions in the browser into transactions on the blockchain. You can see the available wallets in our help center guide, [What crypto wallets can I use with OpenSea](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500007978402)?

Now that you have a crypto wallet installed, you can connect your wallet address to OpenSea.

### Connect to OpenSea

Let's connect your wallet to OpenSea and edit your profile so you're ready to begin interacting on our platform. Navigate to [opensea.io](https://opensea.io) and click the Profile icon.

You'll then be prompted to connect your wallet.

You will continue through multiple prompts, finishing with the connection screen. When you see "Connecting..." OpenSea to your wallet, you're almost done.

If you'd like to change your username, click the three-dot menu on the right side of the screen and select Settings. You will receive an extra security prompt, click Sign and you can begin updating your profile.

Now you can customize your bio, email address, profile photo, and more.

If you ever have trouble viewing your items, make sure your wallet is connected correctly. OpenSea is a window into your wallet address, showing all the NFTs inside.

The heart of OpenSea is [the Browse page and search features](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500003245962). Enjoy buying, selling, and creating NFTs using OpenSea!
