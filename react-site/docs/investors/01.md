# Inspiration

The NFT concept of the registry office [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47) is inspired by the combination of modern technology and traditional values. It is based on the idea of creating unique digital assets that can be used for vital records such as weddings.

The NFT registry office is a digital registry office operated by a decentralized autonomous organization [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47).

The idea of this project arose from the desire to create a new way of registering civil status acts using blockchain and NFT technologies.

The NFT concept of the registry office [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47) is a combination of traditional and modern in art, technology and world order. It offers a new way of civil registration and creates unique digital assets that can become real values for their owners.

This project was inspired by the desire to demonstrate the real utility of NFTs.

We are creating a way for anyone to create NFT event tickets and upload them to the marketplace where everyone else can buy them, while providing a simple user experience available on mobile devices.

We are creating a platform on the basis of which you can create events and sell NFT tickets for them, as well as create a mobile application for checking NFT tickets at the entrance to the club. This is the first function of a decentralized club social network, and is the first module in the [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47) project's trembling map.

Join the Far Far Away Kingdom where we combine love and technology!

## Monetization

Digital rings are not just symbols of your unions - they have a real physical equivalent. Each NFT ring not only symbolizes your union, but also confirms your right to own a real gold ring.

We actively cooperate with jewelers, offering renders of their products in our marketplace. The token of each ring indicates your right to own the physical equivalent.

But it is important to remember that each user can only own one NFT ring. This emphasizes their uniqueness and significance.

An important aspect of our monetization system is that the purchase of rings is made exclusively through our internal token **$ZLATO**. This simplifies the buying process and supports our platform ecosystem.

## Community

We strive to create an active and engaged community around Far Far Away. To increase the social capital of each user, we have developed a number of quests: subscribing in social networks, telling friends about us, creating creative content, etc. For completing these tasks, ambassadors will receive our internal token **$ZLATO** as an airdrop, which they can use to create (minting) new rings or sell on the exchange.

To maintain the honesty and transparency of our community, we require users to complete the KYC (identity verification) procedure. This allows you to exclude the participation of bots and scammers.

## Tokenomics **$ZLATO**

Our tokens are divided into four types:

1. Golden ring of "DAO 999 NFT" collection: The golden NFT ring is a governance token. This confirms membership in the DAO 999 NFT (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and gives members the right to create and vote on proposals. They are important for participating in community governance and influencing the future of our project. Total quantity: 999 pieces
2. Ring of the "Ambassador" collection: NFT ring is a token for entering the application and the status of the ambassador of the project, as well as participation in the airdrop of the **$ZLATO** token. Total quantity: 999 pieces
3. "User" collection ring: The NFT ring is the application's login token. Total quantity: Series of 999 pieces
4. Local currency: **$ZLATO** serves as the local currency on our platform. This token is used for all payments in the ecosystem, including the purchase of NFT rings and other in-app transactions, and allows you to determine how much money the liquidity provider should receive during the distribution of dividends.

The total pool of funds is 999 **$ZLATO** tokens for the initial phase of this project, and the distribution of tokens will be determined based on the specifics of each funding round. Here are some preliminary details:

1. Token offer: total number of tokens 999
   1. DAO ring owners: 50% is the share of tokens that will be allocated to the project team and advisors. This is important to ensure the long-term interest and motivation of the team, as well as to compensate for their efforts and contributions.
   2. Token Sales: 20% is the amount of tokens that will be put up for public sale for public acquisition. This will enable a wide range of investors to participate in the project and make their contribution.
   3. Partners and Ecosystem: 5% - This portion will be used to support partnerships, stimulate ecosystem development and collaborate with other projects and platforms.
   4. Reserves: 10% - will be held in reserve to maintain liquidity, handle future funding rounds and manage unexpected events.
   5. Marketing and community development: 5% - will be used for marketing activities, PR, project promotion, and community development and maintenance.
   6. Bounties and Rewards Programs: 10% - This portion of the tokens will be used for bounty programs, which may include token rewards, bounties, airdrops and other incentives for community members.

In this way, our tokenomics ensures active user participation in the community, keeps our ecosystem functioning, and encourages continued engagement with our platform.

## Public sales of $ZLATO

At the center of our tokenomics is the **$ZLATO**" cryptocurrency with a total supply of 999 tokens. The value of the **$ZLATO** token and NFT DAO rings will increase with each new full moon cycle in 2023, starting at 2 ETH.

According to our development plan, we plan to sell only 20% of our ZLATO tokens, which is 198 tokens.

| Round name      | Price $ZLATO (in ETH) |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Strawberry Moon | 2                     |
| Deer Moon       | 3                     |
| Sturgeon Moon   | 4                     |
| Blue Moon       | 5                     |
| Harvest Moon    | 6                     |
| Hunting Moon    | 7                     |
| Beaver Moon     | 16                    |
| Cold Moon       | 28                    |

We are also implementing the **IGLA** micro-unit, similar to the "satoshi" in bitcoin, making our token more accessible and usable in microtransactions. **IGLA** will be the smallest unit of **$ZLATO** and will be equal to 0.00000001 **$ZLATO**

## Cost of DAO Gold Rings

Introducing the exclusive collection of DAO NFT Rings, consisting of only 999 unique items. Each ring in this limited edition is crafted from 14k gold and features an original design that includes a rotating inner element.

The peculiarity of this collection lies in the unique pricing mechanism. The cost of each NFT DAO ring is expressed in Ethereum and changes in proportion to the value of the **$ZLATO** token at various stages of IDO:

|    Moon name    | Ring Cost (ETH) | Number of Rings | Total Cost (ETH) |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: |
|    New Moon     |      0.05       |       10        |       0.5        |
| Strawberry Moon |        1        |        9        |        9         |
|    Deer Moon    |       1.5       |       18        |        27        |
|  Sturgeon Moon  |        2        |       26        |        52        |
|    Blue Moon    |       2.5       |       34        |        85        |
|  Harvest Moon   |        3        |       44        |       132        |
|  Hunting Moon   |       3.5       |       53        |      185.5       |
|   Beaver Moon   |        8        |       305       |       2440       |
|    Cold Moon    |       14        |       500       |       7000       |
|                 |    **Total**    |     **999**     |     **9999**     |

**The total cost of all rings is 9999 ETH**

We invite you to invest in our unique project and become part of our community. Your investment will not only help support our commitment to building the project, but will also provide you with exclusive privileges and opportunities as a DAO gold NFT ring owner.

### Vesting

In order to provide long-term commitment to investors, tokens can be subject to an vesting schedule. This will mean that the tokens will be provided to investors gradually, and not all at once. For example, tokens can be transferred within 2 years, with 25% of the tokens issued every 6 months.
Tokens can be distributed to investors through a smart contract or a third party platform such as a cryptocurrency exchange or crowdfunding platform.

## Where now

At the moment, we already have an MVP mobile application for iOS and Android for selling NFT tickets to various events. This platform serves as a starting point for attracting our first users and building a community.

**Users** can select the event they are interested in from the list in our mobile application and purchase tickets directly through it.

**Promoters**, on the other hand, use our app to announce parties and sell tickets, and to attract more users. This allows them to successfully solve the tasks of "user acquisition" and "ticket sales".

Our current efforts are focused on distributing the product to our existing user base and expanding our community. Every event hosted through our platform serves to bring people together around common ideas and interests and encourage interaction within the community.
Our users are finding new connections and forming alliances, and this is where we see an opportunity for blockchain integration. We offer users not only to form unions, but also to strengthen them with the help of blockchain technology by registering them in the form of smart contracts in our NFT registry office.

## Web 3.0.

**Decentralization**. This is more than a trend - it is a new national idea.
We represent 999 members of the elite, united by one idea - decentralization. We communicate in our own language. We wear our symbols - rings. Passports, queues, borders, bureaucracy, meaningless rules and degrading laws, banks - all this is the past. We start with marriages, uniting people in pairs without dividing the world of people into countries. We are and always have been one people. We see the failure and uselessness of the old order.

What unites us is an idea, a fairy tale. We are building Far Far Away kingdom. We are open like source code. Our system is transparent to everyone. Simple and clear features, budget and analytics can already be served by AI that works better than humans. AI becomes our advisor.

Data generated from neural networks and social networks already provide detailed insights into how people think and behave. The social rating is also on the blockchain. We already have banking products, budget management, certification systems, specializations, registration, accounting and much more.

Our audience is developers, project owners, influencers, traders who care about the fate of the world and eventually want to transform it for the better with the help of technology and become an influential force. We are DAO 999 NFT, the new digital state. We will create it gradually, which will require a lot of people, ideas and work.

As it develops, it will turn into a metaverse. It will be a world with avatar parties, avatar marriages, business and avatar regulation, avatar economics and rights, and even an avatar constitution.
An oak tree with golden rings around its trunk will become a visual metaphor for the genealogical tree of the dynasty of Far Far Away.
In our vision of the future, technology becomes the key to creating new, decentralized structures of power and public administration. Instead of simply replacing old institutions, we propose using technology to create something new and better - a decentralized, transparent and open society where every person has a voice and every opinion counts.
We want to create a whole new universe - a metaverse where physical limitations disappear and everything is limited only by your imagination. It is a place where people are free to interact with each other, party, get married, do business, and participate in the regulation of this universe.
Ultimately, our goal is to create a place where people can live, work and enjoy life, regardless of their physical location in the real world. This is a visionary goal, but we are confident that with the help of technology we can make it a reality.
