In a far, far away country, in a kingdom Far away, there live princesses who dream of their prince. To find their soulmate, they must take part in a special ritual - the union of wedding rings in the union castle.
The Union Castle is unique and inimitable, as each of its fragments was created using a non-interchangeable NFT token to represent each element of this limited collection consisting of 999 union castles of 27 kingdoms.
At balls in 27 kingdoms, cinderellas turn into princesses, and princes conclude an NFT alliance with the chosen one of their hearts.
This project revives old legends about princesses and their seekers, using new technologies to create unique and inimitable digital assets. It is an amazing combination of traditional and modern, inspiring participants to dream and believe in miracles.

The kingdom is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47), operated by 999 NFT owners depicting union castles. Each NFT owner has a management token and the right to vote when making decisions in [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47), which makes the management of the kingdom decentralized and transparent.
This approach allows NFT owners to take an active part in the management of the kingdom and its development, as well as create new digital assets and projects.

The metaverse controlled by 999 NFT not only inspires participants to dream and believe in miracles, but also demonstrates a new way of organizing business and managing projects in the digital age.

The minting of the first nine locks of the union will take place on March 8 on the marketplace [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/999kingdom). This date was chosen for a reason, as it is the day of the celebration of International Women's Day, which symbolizes the equality and strength of women, as well as the endless union of masculine and feminine principles.
