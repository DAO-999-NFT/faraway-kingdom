# Inspiration

The concept of the NFT registry office [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47) is inspired by a combination of modern technologies and traditional values. It is based on the idea of creating unique digital assets that can be used to record civil status acts, such as weddings.

NFT Registry Office is a digital registry office that is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization [DAO 999 NFT](https://www.xdao.app/137/dao/0x8e7b1334d184c04B2DAc1dfF03F7fE290e5A5a47). The DAO consists of 999 NFT owners, which depict the palaces of the union in the royal style. In the registry office, cinderellas become princesses and form an NFT alliance with princes at the club balls of 27 kingdoms.

The idea of this project arose from the desire to create a new way of recording civil status acts using blockchain and NFT technologies.
